# angular-feature-flags

An AngularJS module that allows you to control the release of new features in your app by putting them behind feature flag driven directives.


### The idea

Abstracting your application functionality into chunks and implementing them as loosely coupled directives. This allows you to completely remove sections of your application by simply toggling a single element.


### How it works

Sets a temporary cookie that allow you to preview the feature for a given time frame (customisable), or manually turn it off when you're done.


### Still to come

A demo.
